Rook Hook - Tinker's Construct - 1.4.7

Rook Hooks are mods that link 1 mod to another compatible mod, and turns them into supported mods, through the use of their apis and source code. It aims to unify mods even further than the modding API will.

This Rook Hook Links the following mods to Tinker's Construct:
InfiCraft 2 (WIP Mod. Also known as Modular Infinity)
EE3 (Transformation recipes)
Mettalurgy 2 (May be put in by mDiyo before I do.)
Cogs of the Machine (Eventually)
Ars Magica (If, of course, he ever looses the freaking attitude).
Pam's Harvest Craft (Probably the 1st or second to be put in, EE3 would be the other).
MineChem (Highly Possible 3rd)
Suggustions...
