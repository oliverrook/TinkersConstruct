Rook Hook - Tinker's Construct - 1.4.7

Attempt to merge Forge Metals and Materials

A sub-project in the super-project, Inficraft - "Filled In"

Rook Hook is an attempt to take existing mods that normally would have differences or have certain elements that didn't quite mix, due to everything in one not be usable by the other. Rook Hook is an attempt to use the APIs of these mods to "stich" them together. In simple terms, it's an attempt to unify the modding community in a way that would do even more than the Modding API.
